* I've never used React through a CDN before and thought it'd be interesting to try it out. I haven't used ReactDOM.render in forever. Definitely brought about some challenges that I'm just used to not having working in a node environment.

* I chose to forgo using a library or an import for the table/list since I don't really like the native HTML tables and didn't find the use-case to be complicated enough to find an external library for it

* Chose to use plotly since there was a React library and was available on a CDN. Also super easy to use and has some cool functionality.

* Since I didn't have much free time over this weekend and given the time restraints, instead of displaying the locations on a map, I just opened a tab to google maps with the location.
